# Introduction to statistics

This is my short course on statistics. I built this course for One Acre Fund to quickly train data analysts and data scientists in basic statistical concepts (in a maths-lite fashion). Working through lessons 1-5 (and the associated homeworks) should provide a good intuitive overview of the statistics required for social science trial analysis. 

## [Lesson 1 - Distributions](https://michael-bar.github.io/Introduction-to-statistics/AMP-1-distributions.html#)

**Highlights:**
* Interpreting and plotting distributions 
* Null hypothesis testing, p-values and significance
* Non-parametric hypothesis testing
* Power and sample size calculations
* Monte-Carlo methods for non-parametric power calculations


## [Lesson 2 - Principles of randomised controlled trials](https://michael-bar.github.io/Introduction-to-statistics/AMP-2-RCT-principles.html)

**Highlights:**
* Formulating effective hypotheses
* Randomization
* Intra-cluster correlation and sample size
* P-value thresholds (aka alpha levels)
* Using minimum detectable effects in sample size calculations

## [Lesson 3 - Linear regression and hypothesis testing](https://michael-bar.github.io/Introduction-to-statistics/AMP-3-regressions_NHT.html)

**Highlights:**
* Analysing cluster randomized trials 
    + Summarizing clusters
    + Cluster-robust methods with mixed-effect models
* Diagnosing and interpreting regression methods

## [Lesson 4 - Logistic regression](https://michael-bar.github.io/Introduction-to-statistics/AMP4_RCT_analysis_p2.html)

**Highlights:**
* Analysing binary outcome variables
    + Fixed effect models
    + Mixed effect logistic modelling

## [Lesson 5 - Advanced statistical concepts](https://michael-bar.github.io/Introduction-to-statistics/AMP5-summary.html)

**Highlights:**
* Introducing the multiple comparison problem (and corrections)
* Introducing positive predictive value and other advanced thoughts on power
* Refreshing some useful R functions
